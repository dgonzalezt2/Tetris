# Key Features
* **Intuitive Graphic Interface:** The game features a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to interact easily with the game board.

* **Classic Tetris Mechanics:** Maintaining the essence of the original game, pieces fall from the top, and players must rotate and strategically place them to complete lines and prevent the board from filling up.
